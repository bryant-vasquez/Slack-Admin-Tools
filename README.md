# Slack-Admin-Tools

## Generating an *admin* api_key
* To be able to use this script you must have an *api_key* generated by slack
    * *To generate an *api_key*** visit [api.slack.com/web](https://api.slack.com/web) at the bottom of the page you should find a `Issue token` or `Re-issue token` button that you need to click.
        **Note you will not see this button until you have logged in*
* **Warning** if you are not an admin user an api_key will still be gernerated when you issue a tolken. However, when you have an api_key generated by a normal user you will not be able to do most of the functions covered in this script. 
    * Example normal user task: message other users, view profile information of other users
    * Example admin user task:  disable, enable, or invite other users
* If your slack permissions change from a normal user to an admin user you will need to visit [api.slack.com/web](https://api.slack.com/web) and click `re-issue` at the bottom of the page  

## Inviting a User 
* This will send an email to the user asking them join your slack team
* If the email used is already apart of your slack team an error will be thrown and no email will be sent
* If a firstname and lastname are given when the user makes an account his name will already be made
* Format
    * `ruby invite.rb --email <email_of_new_user> -k <admin_api_key>`
    * `ruby invite.rb --email <email_of_new_user> --first_name <firstname_of_new_user> --last_name <lastname_of_new_user> -k <admin_api_key>`
* Example
    * `ruby invite.rb --email someones_email@gmail.com -k xoxp-2895144450-5173338419-6395194080-2585ac`
